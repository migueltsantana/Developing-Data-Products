## About the Course Project

This is a deliverable for the course Developing Data Products as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

**Instructions:**

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

## Why a compound interest simulator?

### **Investments... a big topic in uncertain times!**

However, this is time to start investing and planning out your future.

But nothing better than starting with projections and imagine what would you do with it...

## How do I calculate the total value?

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
amount * sum((1+rate/100)^(0:(years-1))*rate/100)
```


Where `amount` is the amount you're willing to invest, `rate` the rate of interest available to you, `years` the number of years you'll be compounding.

## Is there any dataset?

**Not really!** But it's autogenerated for 10 years, based on the user's input with this function:

```{r echo=TRUE}
create_data_frame <- function(rate, amount, years) {
  years_data <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
  values_data <- c(amount)
  for (i in 1:10) {
    values_data <- append(values_data, amount+calculate_interest(rate,
                                                                 amount,
                                                                 i))
  }
  return(data.frame(years=years_data, values=values_data))
}
```
